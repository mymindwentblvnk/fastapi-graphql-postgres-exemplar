virtualenv -p python3.10 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
docker compose up
uvicorn main:app
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql and run the following query

```
query MyQuery {
  members(customInformationFilter: {customField: "favoriteNumber", customValue: 3}) {
    age
